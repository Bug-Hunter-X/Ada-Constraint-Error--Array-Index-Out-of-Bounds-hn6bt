This repository demonstrates a common error in Ada programming: accessing an array element using an index that is out of bounds.  The provided Ada code attempts to assign a value to an array element with an index greater than the array's upper bound. This results in a CONSTRAINT_ERROR exception at runtime.  The solution shows how to prevent this error by adding input validation or using techniques like exception handling to gracefully manage such situations.
